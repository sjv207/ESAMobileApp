2022-08-30 10:50:00,Guidelines for presenters,"<p>Dear participants,</p> <p>In order for the conference to proceed smoothly, it is important that all presenters follow a few simple procedures, which we list below. Please, read them carefully: if we all stick to these basic rules, the conference will be more enjoyable for everyone.</p> <ol type=""1""> <li><p>Before your session, please move to the designated room at least 10 minutes in advance.</p></li> <li><p>Introduce yourself to other speakers in order to confirm the order of the presentations, check whether there are canceled talks, and identify the chair.</p></li> <li><p>Copy your slides on the computer and quickly check that they are visualized correctly. Keep the presentation file open, so that it will be readily available when it is your turn to present.</p></li> <li><p>Regular sessions are scheduled for 18 minutes, while Lightning sessions are scheduled for 10 minutes. These durations include presenter switch and the discussion, so make sure you can reach the podium quickly from where you sit. At the end of your time slot, please kindly stop the conversation, even if there are unanswered questions or unsettled discussions.</p></li> <li><p>Lightning sessions will be chaired by one of the members of the organizing committee.</p></li> <li><p>In regular sessions, the last presenter will be the chair. The session chairs make sure that each presenter is on time and that the sequence of the talks follows the program. The chair also gives cues to the current speaker about the time left in their talk using the cards you will find in the room: 5 mins, 3 mins, 1 min. The first presenter of the session will give cues to the last one.</p></li> <li><p>If a talk in the session is canceled, the speakers should wait for the scheduled duration of the canceled talk. This will ensure that participants coming from other sessions can catch the presentation that they plan to attend.</p></li> </ol> <p>Thank you for your help and cooperation. We wish you a pleasant and productive conference.</p> "
